				<p> I'm a graduate of Algonquin College in Ottawa with a diploma in Computer Programming. I decided to learn more about what powers the software and web on the computers around us in highschool and since then I have been actively learning and improving my skills to create some awesome software and games! <br><br>

				Creating things with this skill has quickly become my passion and I'm 	currently working on a variety of projects in my spare time while looking for a full time position in Ottawa. I'm open to programming in most modern languages and for any OS. My biggest project at the moment is creating a 2D RPG game with the Corona SDK nicknamed Game2D. <br><br>
				
I can program anything from web pages, mobile apps, desktop apps, and even web applications! <br>
If you wish to contact me, you can email me at <a href = "mailto:pauloaguiar@outlook.com"> pauloaguiar@outlook.com </a> or since you're on your phone, just 	<a href="tel:6134071168">Call me</a>  <br><br>

You should also check out some of my previous projects! This site is only an example of my web development skills. 

You can also grab a copy of my resume on the nav bar </p>

Interests: 
<ul>
	<li> Programming and all different types of technology. I enjoy keeping up to date on all current and future tech </li>
	<li> Gaming, specifically MMORPG's and the "open world" tech behind them  </li>
	<li> Loud music with guitars (metalcore, alternative, punk, etc) .. electronic, dubstep, house</li>
	<li> Solving problems. That feeling you get after being stuck on something for a while then finally getting it  </li>
	<li> Open source software and libraries. I love free code :) </li>
	<li> Reddit, Guildwars2, Android, & Google fanboy  </li>

		<h1> August 12, 2013 (Mobile)</h1>
		<p> Heres a secret blog post for anyone taking the time to view my site on their mobile phone! Ive taken some time recently to learn jQuery mobile 	
		so that I could completely revamp my mobile site. Not only does it make developing mobile pages easier, but it also looks really good! Now that a 
		full refresh has been done on both the desktop and mobile pages, I can focus more time into developing some backend for the site. <br><br>
		Ive taken some time to look into a better database host since Hostgator's permissions are ridiculous. Thinking Amazon web services. Il keep you
		guys posted :)</p> <br>

		<h1> August 9, 2013 (Desktop)</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the newly redesigned pauloaguiar91.com! I have been working at Ictinus Design the past few weeks and I have learned so much more about proper web design that I decided to completely revamp my already new site and design something with a lot more attention to detail. The new site is also much quicker to load due to no background image (meh... who needs it anyway?) <br><br>

Im not sure why but every few months when I get better at web design I feel the need to completely revamp my personal site to relect my current level of skill. I do plan to implement some PHP and jQuery functionality but the main goal of the first iteration was to bring the site's front-end a much better look, while taking the time to brainstorm some functionality for the backend. <br><br>

The new nav bar is persistant when scrolling for easy navigation. Less 90's feeling CSS effects and more actual images to make the site feel like it was built in 2013.<br><br>

Some planned features for the next iteration include: <br>
jQuery animations and css tricks to make the site more dynamic <br>
For the blog page, I want to implement a guestbook style system from scratch using PHP. <br> <br>

If you notice anything weird with the site, dont hesitate to email me at <a href = "mailto:pauloaguiar@outlook.com"> pauloaguiar@outlook.com </a></p> <br>
