  	<h1> 2D RPG: In Development </h1>
  		<P> Using the corona SDK, and MillionTile library I am creating an RPG for iPhone and iPad as well as Android phones and tablets.. The following image is in VERY early stages of development, getting a map and actor loaded onto the screen. Movement and animations are implemented. Story is being written as well. Dark times are upon us. <BR>

  	<h1> Wemaloo Android Application: COMPLETED </h1>
  	 <P>This application consisted of a complete login and registration system using JSON in Java, and used the GPS to track the users location and point them to the closest stores around Ottawa so that you can view items on sale. All of the data was stored on a live MySQL database and could be changed dynamically.
