 	<P> Major improvements to Game2D have been done this past week. Saving games along with continuing them is now fully implemented. Also in touch with an artist who is doing an amazing job at breathing life into the game. (sample posted below)<BR> <img src = "img/tile.png">
 		<BR>Theres a lot of work left to be done but with what I have done so far I could probably put this into BETA on the android store within a few months.
 		<BR> The new android game tools are going to definitely be added to the game later on in development. Expect Android leaderboards, and achivements, aswell as on iOS.

 	<P> Game2d finally has a menu screen. Currently the top priorities in development of the game are

 	 <ol> <li>  New game will create a game state and from there you can save.
 	 	<li> Continue game screen must load characters that were 'saved'. Currently keeps track of your name and gender selected. 
 	 		<li> Art! Programmer art isnt very pretty. 

 	 </ol> 

 	 <BR><BR><P>  After all of these are complete I can take a better look at the story and actually figure out whats going to happen in the world. I wont be giving away the story here though :) . Ive also taken some time to polish up the navbar on the site today. I think it looks a lot better than it did before.

 	<P> The RPG project is coming along nicely. Movement with animations is working perfectly, as well as loading appropraite tiles. Still looking for tileset artists. Talking to a second developer who will likely join my team to help code the game at a faster pace. Lots of ideas for combat including a swipe to attack style. Note: writing a game story that actually doesnt suck is hard work!

 	<BR> <BR> Oh I added a commentbox to the blog posts just incase anyone actually feels the need to write me something.

  <P>Firstly I want to say that I write these posts occasionally as time goes on. Some days i'll post every day, some times I will post once a week. These blog posts represent nothing but my opinions.

  	I have been looking into making a game with the Corona SDK. Speaking to a few people about sound effects, programming and graphics. I wont say much yet, but expect some info soon! Thinking maybe a simple 2d rpg or an arcade style game and then start into more complex projects. Ive been spending a bunch of time now that Im done with Algonquin working on this site, making it look as good as it can and enjoying the free time :) Lots of code done for the site today including a major graphical overhaul. <BR> <BR> Im also looking into making images on the About Me page draggable with jQuery. Sorting out the kinks with it, hopefully It will be live within the next few days. <B> Update: Its live now! :)<P> <BR> <BR>  </B>
   

  Thinking of adding a few social networking features into the site (like my twitter feed). Oh, and you can follow me on twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/PauloAguiar91">here </a>
