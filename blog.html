 	<P> Game2d finally has a menu screen. Currently the top priorities in development of the game are

 	 <ol style = "color:white"> <li>  New game will create a game state and from there you can save.
 	 	<li> Continue game screen must load characters that were 'saved'. Currently keeps track of your name and gender selected. 
 	 		<li> Art! Programmer art isnt very pretty. 

 	 </ol> 

 	 <BR><BR><P>  After all of these are complete I can take a better look at the story and actually figure out whats going to happen in the world. I wont be giving away the story here though :) . Ive also taken some time to polish up the navbar on the site today. I think it looks a lot better than it did before.

 	<P> The RPG project is coming along nicely. Movement with animations is working perfectly, as well as loading appropraite tiles. Still looking for tileset artists. Talking to a second developer who will likely join my team to help code the game at a faster pace. Lots of ideas for combat including a swipe to attack style. Note: writing a game story that actually doesnt suck is hard work!

 	<BR> <BR> Oh I added a commentbox to the blog posts just incase anyone actually feels the need to write me something.

  <P>Firstly I want to say that I write these posts occasionally as time goes on. Some days i'll post every day, some times I will post once a week. These blog posts represent nothing but my opinions.

  	I have been looking into making a game with the Corona SDK. Speaking to a few people about sound effects, programming and graphics. I wont say much yet, but expect some info soon! Thinking maybe a simple 2d rpg or an arcade style game and then start into more complex projects. Ive been spending a bunch of time now that Im done with Algonquin working on this site, making it look as good as it can and enjoying the free time :) Lots of code done for the site today including a major graphical overhaul. <BR> <BR> Im also looking into making images on the About Me page draggable with jQuery. Sorting out the kinks with it, hopefully It will be live within the next few days. <B> Update: Its live now! :)<P> <BR> <BR>  </B>
   

  Thinking of adding a few social networking features into the site (like my twitter feed). Oh, and you can follow me on twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/PauloAguiar91">here </a>
